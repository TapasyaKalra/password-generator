# password-generator
Simple password generator using Vanilla JS.

The password is generated character by character based on the options you have selected. 

e.g. If you have selected all types i.e. uppercase, lowecase, symbols and numbers then first character is taken as a random uppercase character, second as a random lowercase and so on till the required number of characters are filled. Then these characters are jumbled to give you the final password.
